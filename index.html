          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>Writing instructions or programming code in a variety of programming languages to create and maintain websites and web apps is referred to as "coding" in the context of web development. Coding is used by web developers to specify a website's structure, layout, behavior, and functionality. <br><br>I am knowledgeable in programming languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, PHP, C, and C++. I have also immediate software skills in Microsoft SQL, MySQL, Excel VBA, and Microsoft Office applications.</p>

          <h3>Time Management</h3>
          <p>Time management is the process of organizing and planning how to divide your time between different activities. Get it right, and you'll end up working smarter, not harder, to get more done in less time – even when time is tight and pressures are high. When you know how to manage your time effectively, you have greater productivity and efficiency, less stress, a better professional reputation, increased chances of advancement, and more opportunities to achieve your life and  career goals.</p>

          <img class="learner-img" src="images/learner.png" alt="learner-img">
          <h3>Fast Learner</h3>
          <p>A fast learner for me is someone who embodies the skills of being a strategic thinker and a good listener and applies them to learning quickly. A strategic thinker can come up with several solutions to solve a problem and will analyze them quickly to determine the best course of action. Likewise, a good listener gets things done because they only have to be told once how to do them.</p>
